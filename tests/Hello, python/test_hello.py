#1 Complete the code below
# pi = 3.14159
# diameter = 3
#
# # Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
# radius = diameter / 2
#
# # Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
# area = pi * (radius ** 2)

#2 Add code to the following cell to swap variables a and b (so that a refers to the object previously referred to by b and vice versa).
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [3, 2, 1]
# a = b
# b = a

# a) Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 1.
# (5 - 3) // 2
# b) Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 0
# 8 - (3 * 2) - (1 + 1)





# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
# alice_candies = 121
# bob_candies = 77
# carol_candies = 109
# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
# to_smash = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3
